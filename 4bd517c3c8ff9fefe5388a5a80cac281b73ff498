- added -mdbtools-checking.patch - fix for mdbtools detection
- added paradox and mdb subpackages
- added bconds for all database drivers
- sorting BRs, %%packages, %%files
- added more directory fixes to -dir.patch (Paradox and mdb drivers)
- added support for HK_DRIVERSDIR (--with-hk_classes-drvdir) to code
  (-dir.patch) - it fixes hk_drivermanager_path() issue, but it isn't
  widely tested.
- removed: sed -i 's,\$(HK_CLASSESDIR),%{_libdir}/%{name},' hk_classes/Makefile.am
  I don't understand what's it for.
